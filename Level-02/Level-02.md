# Level 2 â†’ Level 3

---

## Steps Taken

### 1. Understanding the Task
The objective of this level is to retrieve the password stored in a file named `--spaces in this filename--` located in the home directory.

---

### 2. Locating and Reading the File
After logging in, I used the `ls` command to list the files in the home directory.  
Once I confirmed the presence of the `--spaces in this filename--` file, I used the `cat` command to read its contents.  
Since the filename contains spaces and special characters, I used **tab completion** or escaped the spaces with backslashes (`\`) to properly reference the file.
