## Steps Taken

### 1. Understanding the Task
The objective of this level is to retrieve the password stored in a hidden file inside the `inhere` directory.

### 2. Finding the File
From the home directory, I first navigated into the `inhere` directory.  
To list and locate hidden files, I used the `find` command, which shows all files including those beginning with a dot (`.`).

### 3. Opening the File
Once I identified the hidden file, I used the `cat` command to display its contents and obtain the password.
