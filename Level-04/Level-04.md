## Steps Taken

### 1. Understanding the Task
The objective of this level is to retrieve the password stored in the only human-readable file within the `inhere` directory.  

---

### 2. Identifying the Human-Readable File
After navigating to the `inhere` directory, I used the `file` command on each file to determine its type.  
Most files were non-readable binaries, but one was identified as ASCII text.

### 3. Opening the File
Once I found the ASCII text file, I used the `cat` command to display its contents and obtain the password.
