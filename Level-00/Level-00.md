## Steps Taken

### 1. Understanding the Task
The objective of this level is to retrieve the password stored in a file named `readme` located in the home directory.

### 2. Locating and Reading the File
After logging in, I used the `ls` command to list the files in the home directory.  
Once I confirmed the presence of the `readme` file, I used the `cat` command to display its contents and obtain the password.
